# Production deployment setup on AWS for Kubernetes with Jenkins CI/CD pipeline

## Architecture :

1. Developer will push new code on github
2. Jenkins CI/CD webhook will be triggered
3. Pipeline will start
   - Secure env values with jenkins credential manager
   - Conditional dependency installation (storage cache)
   - Image scan for vulnerabilities and issues
   - EKS image update rollout confirmation
   - Auto rollback in case image updation fails
   - Email alert post pipeline execution
4. Cloud managed Kubernetes with AWS EKS
5. Load balancing using AWS ELB

###

## Production setup

**Requirements : AWS account, Docker Hub account**

***

## **STEP 1 : Jenkins nodes configure**

1. Create two EC2 instances (master, agent)
2. On master :
   - Install jdk latest
   - Install jenkins
   - Attach elastic IP (optional but recommended)
   - Add inbound rule for port : 8080
   - Copy IPv4 and open in new tab with :8080 -> http://ipv4-address:8080
   - Create jenkins account
   - Connect EC2 with local machine or use AWS terminal :
     - navigate to `.ssh` folder
     - run command : `ssh-keygen`
     - Store private key on safe place
     - Copy public key (will use later)
3. On agent :
   - Install jdk latest
   - Install kubectl, aws cli
   - Create a role for EC2 to communicate with EKS and attach the policy with agent EC2
   - Navigate to `.ssh` folder > `authorized_keys`
   - Paste master public key on authorized_keys
   - Save and exit

## **STEP 2 : Connect agent node with jenkins master**

1. Copy agent node username (ubuntu)
2. Copy private IP (if master and agent are within same VPC) otherwise allocate elastic IP for agent and copy IPv4
3. In jenkins dashboard :
   - Settings > credentials > add global credentials > type : ssh with username & private key
   - Add username : ubuntu
   - Add host : private IP
   - Add secret/private key : master private key
   - Save and exit
4. Again on settings :
   - Manage nodes
   - Add a new agent/node
   - Enter basic details
   - Add authentication method and select from global credentials
   - Save and exit
5. Now master can run jobs on agent 🎉

## **STEP 3 : Connect github webhook trigger**

1. Open github > repo you want to connect > repo settings
2. Webhooks > add webhook
3. url : http://ipv4-address:8080/github-webhook/ (IPv4 should not change that's why elastic IP is recommended)
4. Content type : application/json
5. SSL verification : disable
6. Check event type
7. Save and exit
8. Webhook connected 🎉

## **STEP 4 : Webhook trigger jenkins pipeline**

1. Jenkins dashboard > new item > pipeline
2. Select git scm polling
3. Add repo url, branch, pipeline file script path (Jenkinsfile)
4. Add authentication method : username with password or (personal access tokens)
5. Save and exit
6. Pipeline created and will only trigger on github code changes 🎉

## **STEP 5 : AWS EKS Setup with nodegroups**

1. Create cluster in aws console with VPC settings and subnets (recommended : min. 3 subnets, 1 public, 2 private)
2. Attach a role for EKS with EKSClusterPolicy
3. Create one or desired number of nodegroup and select private subnets
4. Specs : atleast t3.small / t3.medium with 20GB storage and 3 nodes. (for small deployments use 1 node)
5. Attach roles and policy to nodegroup :
   - IAM > roles > select EC2
   - Attach policy EC2WorkerNode, ContainerRegistry, CNI
   - Save and exit
6. Attach this role to the nodegroup
7. Nodegroups created 🎉

## **STEP 6 : Authenticate EC2 jenkins agent with EKS**

1. On jenkins agent EC2 :
   - Select IAM role and find ARN
   - Copy ARN > navigate to EKS > cluster > select cluster > access
   - Create a new principle access role and add the ARN
   - Add policy of EKSClusterAdminPolicy
   - Save and exit
2. Now jenkins EC2 can make access to EKS cluster and run commands
3. Done 🎉

## After this setup your production pipeline is ready and now you can add your custom pipeline steps which you want to perform on each code push
